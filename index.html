      <h1>Science of Rahu Kaal</h1>
      <h2>61 Comments / English Blogs / By Deepanshu Giri</h2>
      <p>
        We all have heard this term from our elders to not perform anything
        during the Rahu kaal as every day for 90 minutes there is a Rahu kaal –
        A time period of 90 minutes where we should not buy new things or start
        anything new instead, we should focus on spiritual activities.
      </p>

      <p>
        As working with Panchang for the last several years and observing
        various patterns on a daily basis, which we also shared in our telegram
        group, Rahu kaal standing true to its name was always the mystery, but
        to solve any mystery of the universe, we need to experience it, We need
        to find ways to measure the subtle changes which are happening around us
        as this whole universe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rahu Kaal is calculated by dividing the time of Sunrise- Sunset into
        eight different parts, and based on each day, this time period is given;
        based on local sunrise and sunset time, this time will differ, and it is
        best to check local panchang for the Rahu Kaalam.

        My question to myself was, Why is this time period given to Rahu as any
        time allocated to Rahu in the panchang is when there is a void of
        energy? You are unsure of anything. This is the Zero time period of the
        universe, such as Ashtami and Amavas tithi in panchang belongs to Rahu,
        and this is the tithi of indecisiveness, A tithi of a black hole. Still,
        these tithis are the best remedies for life’s chronic problems.

          To understand this, we need first to understand why there are only
          seven days a week, not 5 or 10- as if it would come to me, I would
          choose to have four days in a week or, like Romans, had eight days in
          a week, or Egyptians had ten days in their weekly calendar but since
          Hindu calendar was based on the movement of planets and all rituals
          are designed around this calendar so the humans can uplift themselves
          and gather energy from space using the movement of planets, As human
          DNA corresponds to different planets in different months and energy of
          planets and this is what our ancient rishis called as Graha Shanti.
        </p>

        <p>
          This whole world works on a rhythm from human life to the Stock
          market. This rhythm is superior to any other cycle; as on Twitter till
          now, without any technical parameter and against all odds, only on the
          basis of this cycle, I was able to point out 15 stocks and from the
          last three years, over ten multi-baggers. Still, we can use the same
          cycle and use it for the whole universe.
        </p>

        <p>
          Coming back to the number of days in a week confining to seven, given
          we have seven planets in this universe and each day is named after
          them starting from Sunday. Moreover, the 28-day moon cycle is divided
          into four parts- New Moon- Full Moon- Half Moon – So the Moon will be
          in Kendra precisely 90 degrees from the New Moon origin after seven
          days. The day New Moon is rising and after every seven days, the same
          weekday will be repeated and based on this, you can make predictions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Such as, any month which has 5 Saturdays will be extremely tough, and
          oil/steel/machinery prices will rise in this month; a month with five
          Mondays will bring emotional turmoil but will be suitable for FMCG
          sectors and Car Sales, but every day when Sunrise- we calculate the
          tithi based on the distance between Sun and Moon and this Tithi is the
          emotion and relation between not only Sun and Moon but also between –
          Atman and Mann.
        </p>

        <p>
          Atman is someone who is deeply buried inside us but cannot communicate
          until and unless we go into deep isolation and listen to our own
          sound- All the Beej Mantras are nothing but the sounds of Atman, and
          we chant them to get into resonance with our own selves, but since we
          are busy in the outer world, we use our shell which helps to
          communicate which is Maan- the mirror image of Atman. Most people in
          this world operate in the reverse direction as they communicate from
          Mann to Atman as I need Car, House, and Job as these all are liked by
          Mann and communicated to Atman with a belief system that this can make
          me happy while the happiest people on earth are those who communicate
          from inside to outside clearly telling the world- This is what I
          really require to be happy as this is my soul desire.
