      <h1>Science of Rahu Kaal</h1>
      <h2>61 Comments / English Blogs / By Deepanshu Giri</h2>
      <p>
        We all have heard this term from our elders to not perform anything
        during the Rahu kaal as every day for 90 minutes there is a Rahu kaal –
        A time period of 90 minutes where we should not buy new things or start
        anything new instead, we should focus on spiritual activities.
      </p>

      <p>
        As working with Panchang for the last several years and observing
        various patterns on a daily basis, which we also shared in our telegram
        group, Rahu kaal standing true to its name was always the mystery, but
        to solve any mystery of the universe, we need to experience it, We need
        to find ways to measure the subtle changes which are happening around us
        as this whole universe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rahu Kaal is calculated by dividing the time of Sunrise- Sunset into
        eight different parts, and based on each day, this time period is given;
        based on local sunrise and sunset time, this time will differ, and it is
        best to check local panchang for the Rahu Kaalam.

        My question to myself was, Why is this time period given to Rahu as any
        time allocated to Rahu in the panchang is when there is a void of
        energy? You are unsure of anything. This is the Zero time period of the
        universe, such as Ashtami and Amavas tithi in panchang belongs to Rahu,
        and this is the tithi of indecisiveness, A tithi of a black hole. Still,
        these tithis are the best remedies for life’s chronic problems.

        To understand this, we need first to understand why there are only seven
        days a week, not 5 or 10- as if it would come to me, I would choose to
        have four days in a week or, like Romans, had eight days in a week, or
        Egyptians had ten days in their weekly calendar but since Hindu calendar
        was based on the movement of planets and all rituals are designed around
        this calendar so the humans can uplift themselves and gather energy from
        space using the movement of planets, As human DNA corresponds to
        different planets in different months and energy of planets and this is
        what our ancient rishis called as Graha Shanti.
      </p>

      <p>
        This whole world works on a rhythm from human life to the Stock market.
        This rhythm is superior to any other cycle; as on Twitter till now,
        without any technical parameter and against all odds, only on the basis
        of this cycle, I was able to point out 15 stocks and from the last three
        years, over ten multi-baggers. Still, we can use the same cycle and use
        it for the whole universe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Coming back to the number of days in a week confining to seven, given we
        have seven planets in this universe and each day is named after them
        starting from Sunday. Moreover, the 28-day moon cycle is divided into
        four parts- New Moon- Full Moon- Half Moon – So the Moon will be in
        Kendra precisely 90 degrees from the New Moon origin after seven days.
        The day New Moon is rising and after every seven days, the same weekday
        will be repeated and based on this, you can make predictions.
      </p>

        Such as, any month which has 5 Saturdays will be extremely tough, and
        oil/steel/machinery prices will rise in this month; a month with five
        Mondays will bring emotional turmoil but will be suitable for FMCG
        sectors and Car Sales, but every day when Sunrise- we calculate the
        tithi based on the distance between Sun and Moon and this Tithi is the
        emotion and relation between not only Sun and Moon but also between –
        Atman and Mann.
      </p>

      <p>
        Atman is someone who is deeply buried inside us but cannot communicate
        until and unless we go into deep isolation and listen to our own sound-
        All the Beej Mantras are nothing but the sounds of Atman, and we chant
        them to get into resonance with our own selves, but since we are busy in
        the outer world, we use our shell which helps to communicate which is
        Maan- the mirror image of Atman. Most people in this world operate in
        the reverse direction as they communicate from Mann to Atman as I need
        Car, House, and Job as these all are liked by Mann and communicated to
        Atman with a belief system that this can make me happy while the
        happiest people on earth are those who communicate from inside to
        outside clearly telling the world- This is what I really require to be
        happy as this is my soul desire.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Book on Atmakarka is the sole attempt, so anyone who reads it can
        understand the deeper meaning of their soul desire and be able to
        predict patterns and life choices based on Atmakarka as every work we do
        in this life and which becomes legendary is only due to one reason that
        we believed in it so much as it came out of our deep-rooted knowledge of
        Atman, which we were carrying from several lifetimes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Coming back to Tithi which governs our emotions, our feelings and the
        way we communicate from Atman to Mann- what message are we carrying, how
        are we feeling in a day? What our Atman is trying to communicate as if
        you see Rahu Kaal- it is working in alternate groups and pair.

        Every day, based on which planet is ruling the day, there is a solar
        energy flare disturbance, and this flare disturbance happens, which
        blocks the communication of the Sun and Moon; it is a grahan happening
        at a minor level of 22.5 degrees. This 90 mins is completely scientific
        as even the ISS- International space station, which is a man-made
        satellite is rotating at a speed of 90 mins/rotation as this is not by
        choice but by the necessity. Similarly, Rahu/Ketu, which are satellites
        of the Moon, blocks energy to Moon for 90 mins creating darkness in the
        absence of communication.

      <p>
        One thing you will notice during the dasa of Rahu or people who have
        prominent Rahu in their chart is the way these people speak; there is a
        lot of air movement and clarity in their speech, just like the language
        of snakes, a lot of hissing sounds, cleaning saliva which is coming out
        of the mouth from both ends as there is an absence of Atman, darkness
        comes in the head, and this can lead to all the wrong decisions, but
        this is also the time period which gives you time to connect to your own
        self and the realm of Rahu.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the best time to perform any remedies related to materialistic
        things. Solving problems of life, removing any chronic issues in life,
        and making offerings to ancestors this is the best time to it; one of
        the remedies you can try today is to offer Milk and honey for seven days
        regularly to the bottom of any tree. You can see the results of which
        will be your life will start to change for the better as suddenly events
        will happen which will be surprising for you.
